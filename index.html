        <h1>About Food Court</h1>
        <br>
        <p>A food court is often one of the most popular destinations for casual shoppers who want to spend several hours in a bustling shopping mall. It may also be the only local outlet for certain specialty or ethnic foods, which creates a different kind of attraction for restaurant owners.Food courts consist of a number of vendors at food stalls or service counters. Meals are ordered at one of the vendors and then carried to a common dining area. The food may also be ordered as takeout for consumption at another location, such as a home, or workplace. </p>
